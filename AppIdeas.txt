My Three App Ideas

1. Linguistics Language Families/Language EvolutionTree App:
As far as I can tell, I don't think an app like this exists. It will show all of the world language families, e.g. Indo-European, Altaic, Sino-Tibetan, etc. and individual languages and how those languages relate to each other. 

2. Student Finance Scenario App:
Student Debt vs. Future Income calculator/Scholarships vs Tuition cost calculator. 
An app to give students (especially Arkansas students) a financial overview of their college aspirations. It will show  student whether or not their career goal is financially viable at the institution of their choosing. 

3. Death at the Wheel/Scared Awake:
App that keeps people awake while driving at night by frightening them awake periodically There are multiple apps like this that exist already. Most are bland. I'd like to give a little bit of pizazz by adding an element of horror. Think Stephen King!
